# Machine Learning Project: Energy Production Forecasting in Wind Farms

We collaborated on developing a machine learning forecasting model for predicting energy production in wind farms. The project included:
- **Understanding the Data**: Conducted EDA to explore insights into the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineered lagged versions of power data for accurate predictions.
- **Model Development**: Used time series variation of linear regression for energy production prediction.
- **Backtesting Strategies**: Employed backtesting to refine and validate predictive performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Calculated error metrics to assess and improve model accuracy.

## Skills

- **TensorFlow**: Used for developing and optimizing machine learning models.
- **ONNX**: Leveraged for model interoperability and deployment.
- **Backtesting**: Applied to validate and enhance model accuracy.
- **Python (Programming Language)**: Proficient in data preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Applied techniques for forecasting energy production in wind farms.
